# Whose_Hotter

## Description
For our first project in our coding bootcamp, we were tasked on creating an interactive application for the user that uses two server side Application Platform Interfaces (API). Our front end was built using HTML, Javascript and a CSS framework called Bulma. We created an application that will tell the user of the 5 day forecast for a city along with what the language the country speaks. The user is able to load previously searched cities from the local storage their computer has for the city to remind the user of previous searches. 

## Installation
No installation needed. <br />
Live deployed pages is located at: https://gabe-velasquez.github.io/Whose_Hotter/

## Usage
To start using the application, you will first select a country from a dropdown list located in the middle of the document. After a country is selected, please select a city in the corresponding country. After a choice is made, weather forecasts and information about the city will be displayed below the country box displayed on the webpage. If you were curious on what you previously searched, it will be listed on the navbar on the top of the webpage.
